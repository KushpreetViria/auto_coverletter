# Auto Coverletter

###### After sending out so many coverletters manually, I ended up automating the process with this script, which uses just a generic template that I can quickly alter to fit any company.

- Simple script to replace occurances of the following string in a docx document with user provided alternatives:
  - `<DATE>`, `<STREET_ADDRESS>`, `<CITY_PROVINCE>`, `<COMPANY_NAME_FULL>`, `<COMPANY_NAME_SHORT>`, `<POSITION_NAME>`
- Outputs PDF
